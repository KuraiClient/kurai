## Where can I download Kurai Client?
Kurai Client is currently a Work-In-Progress, and has not been released to the public yet. However, when it does be sure to go to our Discord Server and look for the [#download](https://discord.com/channels/1240298433294893116/1244187997231120424) channel.

From there you can choose to either use the:

### Launcher (recommended option)
- Use our Kurai Launcher which automatically downloads the latest dll and injects it for you.

### Standalone DLL
- You can download the DLL by itself, and use a third-party injector to inject into the game, however this is not the safest approach, and we may not be able to help you in such a case.

## What devices do Kurai Client support?
Kurai supports ONLY **64-bit Windows 10/11**. You can check if your using a 64-bit machine by looking in your settings. And clicking the button saying "System". Then scroll on the sidebar to find "About", and you should see something like this:

- If it says "64-bit operating system, x64-based processor", you can use Kurai Client.
- If it says "32-bit operating system, x64-based processor", you must install the 64-bit version of Windows. Look up how to do that online.
- If it says "32-bit operating system, x86-based processor", you will not be able to use Kurai Client.
- If your PC is ARM or Qualcomm based, you can't use this client either.
